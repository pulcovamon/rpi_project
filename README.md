# rpi_project
Weather station with Arduino and RPi communication
microcontrollers : Raspberry Pi 3 and Arduino nano clone
modules          : DHT11 (temperature and humidity sensor), HC-05 (bluetooth module)
displey          : 3.5 inch RPI LCD (B) WaveShare

RPi senszors in process

Arduino stays in 3d printed case outside,
RPi with display stays inside
and shows outside and inside (in process) temperature and humidity.
